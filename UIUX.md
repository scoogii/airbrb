# UIUX

Our overall aim of the design was to create a site that advocates to all users, putting
accessibility at the forefront of our vision. This is exemplified through various
small details including making buttons clearly visible as well as recognisable,
tooltips on hover over such buttons, and many more features displayed on the website.

We also aimed to reduce complexity that may arise when accessing certain features or
pages, by making everything accesible by one or two clicks on each page, with a
strong conviction in the positioning of every single element on the page to allow
the user to think less about what they want to do and where they need to be.

A lot of emphasis was placed on making our app less intimidating, by using consistent
alignment of elements vertically and horizontally as well as implementing a base
font for all our pages and a harmonious colour scheme as well. An example of this
can be seen on the pages displaying listings where we utilise the 12 column
principle using a Grid to partition the listings into even slots.

The visual hierarchy was an aspect of the app we considered heavily and all pages
follow this evidently, such as:

* Size: We ensured larger elements depicted something more important such as an
action

* Color: This was accentuated through buttons, where contained variants represented
a successful/confirming action compared to outlined variants that depicted going
back or cancelling a decision.

In summary, our ultimate goal in the development of this application was not only
to create a functional app that could be viable in the real world, but to promote
a friendly and welcoming experience for the users where everything is accessible
and 'makes sense'. We feel that we succeeded in doing so and other considerations
were made however couldn't be implemented due to time constraints (e.g. Dark Mode).
